Chapter Six: Introspection

GraphQLâ€™s introspection system uses __ to differentiate scalar and object types from the types part of the system
The introspection system is valuable in determining the fields present for each object type using the following types: __ schema, __ type, __ typekind, __field, __ inputvalue, __ enumvalue, __ directive.
Together these types organize the way the operations interact with the schema and its different object and scalar types.
