Chapter 2: (https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest/)
1. Graphql avoids over and underfetching data as REST does
2. Graphql fetchs only specified and required data by user. REST retrieves useless data in the JSON response
3. Rapid Product Iterations on the Frontend. Changes in UI wont require any change in the backend side.
4. Benefits of a Schema & Type System: Once defined type system schema using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) backend and frontend teams need no further communication. Both teams are aware of the definite structure of the data that’s sent over the network.

Chapter Two: Queries and Mutations

Queries can be organized by objects and specific fields of that object to request for specific information
Queries can contain arguments to ask for information at a specific index or place (i.e. hero (id : 1000) or hero (last : 1))
Separate queries can be made unique using aliases as their object field names.
Using aliases allows for multiple queries that may be requesting the same type of information.
The use of fragments is useful in defining types of queries so that you can use the “…fragmentName" format to implement similar types of queries.
Operation types and names are used to identify types of operations (query, mutation, and subscription) and to name specific operations so that they are identifiable within the code and during debugging.
The use of variables are important when the user of the client application can have different options to choose.
When using variables you can force a non-null selection (using !) and also pick default values to use as an input for the operation.
In certain situations a directive can be useful should a certain boolean be true or false.
There are two types of directives: @include which includes a variable parameter in the operation should a certain value be true and @skip which skips a variable parameter in the operation should a certain value be true.
Mutations help clients write into the database and update any information using the mutation operation.
In-line fragments allow clients to access different types of data that depend on the input parameter for an operation.
