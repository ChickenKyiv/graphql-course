Chapter One: Introduction

GraphQL is a server side service that allows a more efficient way to request data from the server or database.
It is an alternative for the use of REST API to for some data on the backend and database.
It uses queries with specific fields to request for information and the server checks queries against schemas before performing a function to send back the requested information back to the client.

Chapter 1: Introduction to GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs, developed and open-sourced by Facebook. It serves as an alternative to REST, but way better in terms of its power, efficiency, and flexibility.
Due to an increase in the usage of mobile devices and a sloppy network, a need for an efficient data loading arises. The declarative data fetching feature of GraphQL increases the efficiency of data loading because it only responds with the exact amount of information requested by a client.
Variety of front-end frameworks (i.e React, Ember, Angular e.t.c), makes it difficult to build an API that satisfies the requirement of all the frameworks. GraphQL solves the problem by exposing a single endpoint responding to queries instead of multiple endpoints returning a fixed data structures.
The breaking features of GraphQL makes it possible for a fast and continuous deployment; because it provides a possibility of building features on-the-fly.
NOTE: GraphQL is not a database, but just a query language for APIs. Its database agnostic, and can be used in any context where an API is used.

Above is the summary of what I learned from the first tutorial, it doesn't provide any information on how to start using it yet. Nevertheless, I had explored more helpful docs from the site and I'm able to set up a simple GraphQL server on Express.

Chapter 1: Intro (GraphQL Fundamentals)
In this chapter there are 4 subsections: GraphQL Fundamentals, GraphQL is the better REST, Core Concepts and Big Picture (Architecture) of GraphQL. Each section followed its title, it was imperative to understand what are the components of GraphQL as well as the history in order to understand it's progression and uses. Taking this information led to the comparison with REST and why, ultimately, GraphQL was conceived. The Core Concepts chapter helped give names to the components and share a bit more in-depth on their jobs in order to make GraphQL work the way it does.
The wrap up of this chapter was the subsection of uses of GraphQL. Looking at the capabilities of GraphQL it makes sense that Facebook conceived this framework. It can be used independently across the needs of any organization. The ability to use it with existing databases and what is already present makes it practical and efficient which was the most surprising and helpful aspect of the information provided.
Now that I have a greater understanding of its uses and the basics of GraphQL, I look forward to working on the infrastructure in more depth.
