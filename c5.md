Chapter Five: Execution

During execution of operations, functions called resolvers are called for each field
Each function calls for the next resolver for the next field until the leaves are reached (scalar types).
A resolver function contains four arguments:
obj: previous object
args: parameters provided by client
context: a value that corresponds to contextual info
info: field information
Resolvers use a promise for asynchronous calls to the database
To return field information, resolvers simply access the fields of the obj referenced from the previous object and returns them
Scalar coercion occurs when GraphQL internally defines enum type object fields as numbers but will display them with their appropriate enum values
With lists, GraphQL uses a list of promises and waits until all promises are completed before moving on
During each resolved function, it is placed in a key-value map to appropriately display the information to the client
