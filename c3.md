Chapter Three: Schemas and Types

Schemas are created to determine what type of data can be asked from the server
Object types can be defined using the type keyword and with each object type, fields can be added in to determine what type of information each object the client can withdraw from that type of object.
Using ! can force a type to be non-nullable
Each field can take in zero or multiple arguments and can have set default values for each argument if the arguments are not required.
There are query and mutation types that are defined within the schema
Query and mutation types describe the types of queries and mutations a client can perform on the Graph QL interface.
They often contain the object types with any necessary argument parameters.
Scalar types are the leaves of the schema tree
The five main scalar types in GraphQL include strings, ints, floats, booleans, and ID.
Enum types can be used to map a certain type to select values
Non-null modifiers can be applied to specific types such as String and Arrays to force certain types of inputs
Interfaces are used to define an objectâ€™s fields and it is useful to diversify different object types who might root from the same interface.
A union type is similar to interfaces but without the requirement of fields. It defines a set of object types that can be returned for a certain query
Input types can be objects with fields that GraphQL can expect from the client request. You can define input type objects by using the type keyword.
