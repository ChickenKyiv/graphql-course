Chapter Four: Validation

Graph QL’s type system makes it easier to detect any invalid queries and allows for the developer to receive any errors on invalid queries.
One example of an invalid query is call to a fragment within a fragment.
Another common invalid query is requesting for a field of an object type that doesn’t exist.
The previous example can apply to scalar types as well as they are the leaves of a schema and would not contain any accessible fields.
Another invalid query is the misuse of fragments to access a root object type
